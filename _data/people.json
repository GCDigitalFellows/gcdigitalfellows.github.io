She was also editor of the Journal of Digital Humanities and Digital Humanities Now. She earned her Ph.D. in English Language and Literature from the University of Maryland. Her research combines advanced computational methods such as topic modeling and social network analysis with more traditional literary analysis to study 20th and 21st-century American literature, particularly ekphrastic poetry (poems that take the visual arts as their subject) by contemporary women poets. More broadly, she is interested in the 20th and 21st century American literature, verbal-visual studies, scholarly communication, and digital humanities.</p>","image":""},"sz":{"shortname":"sz","name":"Stephen Zweibel","title":"Digital Scholarship Librarian","email":"","website":"","twitter":"@SteveZweibel","github":"https://github.com/szweibel","bio":"<p>Stephen Zweibel is the Data and Digital Projects Librarian at CUNY Graduate Center and the lead developer of the NEH-funded DH Box, a digital humanities laboratory in the cloud.

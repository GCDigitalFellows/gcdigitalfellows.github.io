    <p>Workshops build on each other such that successive workshops use skills developed in earlier ones. All participants will attend workshops on core skills, then choose which skills they wish to develop further through advanced workshops. The following is a preliminary schedule (subject to change) of the activities planned for the five-day program.</p>

      <p>Each day of the Digital Research Institute, there will be four workshop sessionsâ€”two in the
      morning and two in the afternoon, with breaks between each session. Workshop
      topics are scaffolded so that successive workshops will use skills developed
      in earlier workshops. All attendees will participate in the same core workshops,
      and then will be able to choose between different tracks for the advanced
      workshops. The following is a preliminary schedule of some of the workshops and activities planned for the five-day program. </p>

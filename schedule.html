      <!--Each day of the Digital Reseatch Institute is divided into four workshop sessions--two in the
      morning and two in the afternoon, with breaks between each session.-->
      Workshops build on each other such that successive workshops use skills developed
      in earlier ones. All participants attend workshops on core skills, 
      then choose which skills they wish to develop further through advanced workshops.  
      The following is a preliminary schedule (subject to change) for the five-day program: </p>
